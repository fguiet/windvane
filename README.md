# Solar powered, waterproof windvane

## Foreword

Following my first project ie a [solar powered waterproof anemoter](https://github.com/fguiet/anemometer), let me introduce you : the solar powered waterproof windvane.
Mostly based on the same form factor, I only had to re-designed the top part with Fusion 360.

## 3D Models

All 3D models can be found on my [Thingiverse for free](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4252764) or in the model3d folder of this project

I included a mount system that fits on H pole like this one :

If needed, I can provide the 3d model solar panel holder

## In real life

* Tampered ESP32 DevKit (I replaced the AMS1117 LDO 1v dropout by HT7333 only 250mA but low dropout)
